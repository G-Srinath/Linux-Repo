# Linux Learning Modules

Becoming an expert in Linux administration and preparing for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam is a great goal! Here's a structured study pattern and plan to guide you:

### 1. **Begin with the Basics (Week 1-2)**
   - **Goals**: Understand the core concepts of Linux, basic commands, and file structures.
   - **Topics**:
     - Introduction to Linux and its history.
     - Linux distributions (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.).
     - The Linux file system structure.
     - Basic Linux commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `echo`, `grep`, etc.
     - Working with files and directories.
     - Permissions: `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.
     - Understanding users and groups.
     - Basic shell scripting.
   - **Resources**:
     - Books: *"The Linux Command Line"* by William Shotts.
     - Platforms: Linux Academy, Udemy, or YouTube tutorials.
   - **Practice**: Install a Linux distribution on a virtual machine or dual boot your system and spend time navigating the terminal.

### 2. **Understanding System Administration (Week 3-4)**
   - **Goals**: Learn how to manage the system and interact with users, files, and processes.
   - **Topics**:
     - System initialization and boot process (GRUB, systemd).
     - Understanding and managing processes: `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `nice`, `renice`.
     - Managing user accounts: `useradd`, `usermod`, `userdel`, `passwd`.
     - Managing file systems: partitioning, `fdisk`, `mkfs`, mounting, and unmounting file systems.
     - Working with storage devices: `df`, `du`, `mount`, `umount`, swap management.
     - Automating tasks with `cron` and `at`.
     - Managing system logs: `journalctl`, `/var/log/`.
   - **Resources**:
     - RHCSA official curriculum.
     - Red Hat documentation (available online).
     - Practice: Setup and manage users and groups on your Linux system. Practice mounting, partitioning, and managing file systems.

### 3. **Mastering Network Configuration & Security (Week 5-6)**
   - **Goals**: Learn networking, firewall, and basic security measures.
   - **Topics**:
     - Networking basics: `ip`, `ifconfig`, `ping`, `netstat`, `ss`.
     - Network configuration: IP addressing, DNS configuration.
     - Managing services and daemons: `systemctl`, `service`.
     - Firewalls: `firewalld`, `iptables`.
     - Security concepts: SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux).
     - Configuring SSH and secure access.
   - **Resources**:
     - Red Hat official documentation.
     - Networking tutorials specific to Linux.
   - **Practice**: Set up a basic server with SSH access and configure firewall rules.

### 4. **Advance to Storage Management & File Sharing (Week 7-8)**
   - **Goals**: Manage storage, file systems, and sharing.
   - **Topics**:
     - Managing Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
     - Working with disk quotas.
     - Sharing files over the network: NFS, Samba.
     - Archiving and compressing files: `tar`, `gzip`, `zip`.
   - **Resources**:
     - LVM tutorials on Linux Academy or similar platforms.
     - Practice setting up file-sharing between systems.
   - **Practice**: Create, extend, and manage logical volumes, and configure file-sharing services like NFS or Samba.

### 5. **Practice and Exam Prep (Week 9-12)**
   - **Goals**: Solidify understanding of the topics and focus on exam scenarios.
   - **Topics**:
     - Review all key topics: Users, groups, file permissions, networking, system services, etc.
     - Time management and problem-solving practice for the exam.
     - Review RHCSA-specific exam objectives:
       - Manage users and groups.
       - Manage permissions.
       - Configure and secure SSH.
       - Manage SELinux.
       - Work with storage.
   - **Resources**:
     - RHCSA exam guide or prep books.
     - Practice exams and exercises (available online on Linux Academy, Udemy, etc.).
     - Red Hat's own RHCSA exam objectives page.
   - **Practice**: Simulate exam scenarios on a test system.

### 6. **Additional Resources**
   - **Books**:
     - *"RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification Study Guide"* by Michael Jang.
     - *"RHCSA/RHCE Practice Exam"* books (Michael Jang has one).
   - **Hands-On**: Always have a Linux system to practice on, whether itâ€™s a VM, a cloud server, or a dual boot.
   - **Videos**: Supplement your learning with video tutorials on YouTube, Linux Academy, or RHCSA exam-specific courses.

### Suggested Study Routine
- **Daily Practice**: Dedicate 1-2 hours every day to practice commands and administration tasks.
- **Weekly Focus**: Focus on a specific topic each week. Take notes and create flashcards for commands.
- **Simulated Exams**: Take practice exams once a week during the last 2-3 weeks before the exam.

### Final Tip
Be consistent with practice and troubleshooting. The more you encounter issues and solve them, the stronger your Linux skills will become!
