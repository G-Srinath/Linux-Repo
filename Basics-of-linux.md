# Basics of Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that controls the hardware and software of a computer, managing tasks like memory allocation, running applications, and file management. Unlike proprietary systems (e.g., Windows or macOS), Linux is built on open-source principles, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

### Key Components of Linux

1. **Kernel**: The core of the operating system that manages hardware resources (e.g., CPU, memory) and enables communication between hardware and software.


2. **Shell**: The command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the OS by typing commands. Popular shells include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.


3. **File System**: Linux organizes files in a hierarchical directory structure, starting from the root directory (`/`), with standard directories like `/home`, `/etc`, and `/var`.


4. **Distributions**: Various versions of Linux that package the kernel with software and utilities. Popular ones include Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, and Arch.

### Basic Linux Concepts

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Linux is primarily operated using text-based commands in a terminal.


2. **File Permissions**: Files and directories in Linux have permissions (read, write, execute) assigned to users, groups, and others.


3. **Package Management**: Linux uses package managers like `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu) and `yum` (CentOS/Fedora) to install, update, and remove software.


4. **Processes**: Programs running in the background or foreground. You can manage them using commands like `ps`, `top`, `kill`, etc.

### Basic Linux Commands

1. `pwd`: Print working directory (shows your current location).
2. `ls`: List files in the current directory.
3. `cd`: Change directory (e.g., `cd /home/user`).
4. `cp`: Copy files (e.g., `cp source.txt dest.txt`).
5. `mv`: Move or rename files (e.g., `mv oldname.txt newname.txt`).
6. `rm`: Remove files (e.g., `rm file.txt`).
7. `chmod`: Change file permissions (e.g., `chmod 755 file.sh`).
8. `man`: Show the manual page for commands (e.g., `man ls`).

Linux is highly customizable, secure, and widely used in server environments, cloud computing, and development work.
